## VLSM
VLSM, or Variable Length Subnet Masking, stands as a technique in subnetting designed to optimize IP address allocation within a network. It adjusts the subnet mask size according to the specific number of computers or hosts needing IP addresses in each subnet. By breaking down a larger network into smaller subnets of varying sizes and assigning netmasks based on host requirements, VLSM offers flexibility to network administrators. 

# VLSM Tree
The following is the outcome of subdividing the larger subnet into smaller networks.
